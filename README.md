# Jerry-Angelo-T.-Camacho-JATC-Website
This website is my answer to an activity in the midterm of the first semester of ITRACKB1: Web Design and Technologies where we apply Chapter 2 lesson 9 to Chapter 3 lesson 1. 
We are tasked to make a website while using table markup, form and interactive elements as well as CSS.

The following conditions were met: 
1. Make use of the different types of selectors discussed in the CSS lesson. There should
    be at least two (2) CSS declarations used per category of selector in the overall
    design of the website.
2. You have the freedom to change the color/design of the elements. HOWEVER, make
    sure that you apply a minimalistic design. Design as if you are creating a website for a
    client: simple/minimalistic, professional and clean.
3. Color changes presented in the links should be applied.
4. All contents for the webpage should be retained EXCEPT for the Exam Proper container
    of the Quiz App webpage. In that page, you have the freedom to change the questions
    given as long as the following input type/form elements are present:
  a. Text
  b. Radio button
  c. Checkbox
  d. File
  e. Dropdown
  f. Text area
5. Replace the name of the website (in this case, “A.Morales”), with your name. You also
  have the freedom to create your own logo out of your name. This name/logo should be a
  link to the home/about/landing page depicting a picture and description of yourself
  and your overall knowledge in web designing so far. This “home/about/landing
  page” should be the first page to be loaded upon users visiting your site.
6. Social medias used in the footer should redirect to your socials upon clicking.
7. Submission of the output should be via a link hosted thru Github.
